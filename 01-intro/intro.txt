Definition of a Database ?
A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for easy access,
retrieval, manipulation, and management.

Types of Databases ?

Relational Databases (RDBMS):
    Stores data in tables with rows and columns.
    Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage data.
    Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite.

NoSQL Databases:

    Designed for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
    Flexible schemas, allowing data to be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
    Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB.


MongoDB ?
    MongoDB is a type of database that stores data in a flexible way using documents (like JSON objects), 
    instead of traditional tables. It is a NoSQL database, meaning it doesn't require a fixed structure 
    (schema) for storing data, making it easy to handle different types of information.
    MongoDB is good for handling large amounts of data, and it's easy to scale when needed. It's commonly 
    used in applications that need fast and flexible data storage, like websites, mobile apps, and big data 
    systems.

Key Features of MongoDB ??
    1- Document-Orient
    2- Schema-less
    3- Indexing
    4- Aggregation Framework
    5- Scalability

--------------------------------

MySQL    |    MongoDB 

Database |  Database
tables   |  collections
rows     |  documents
columns  |  fields

--------------------------------

[
  {
    "name": "Sadam",
    "age": 22
  },
  {
    "name": "Ali",
    "age": 23
  }
]


database    = students
collections = users
documents   = 2
fields      = name , age

---------------------------------

BSON ?
    BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary representation of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 
    It is the format used by MongoDB to store documents in a more efficient, compact, and 
    machine-readable way.

    The document that was stored in a JSON , for use it was just JSON data , but behind the scene,
    it is in BSON.
    BSON converts the data into binary form , so that the traversal should be fast.
