###### Introduction

MongoDB is a **NoSQL, document-oriented** database that stores data in BSON format, making it **flexible** and **scalable**. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB **doesn't require a fixed schema**, allowing dynamic data modeling.

#### CRUD Operations

- **Create** â€“ Insert documents into collections.  
- **Read** â€“ Retrieve and filter data efficiently.  
- **Update** â€“ Modify existing documents.  
- **Delete** â€“ Remove unwanted documents.
